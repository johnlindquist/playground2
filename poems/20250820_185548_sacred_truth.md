In quiet moments when the world grows still,
And rushing thoughts begin to slow their pace,
The ancient truths reveal themselves at will
To those who seek with patient, humble grace.

Not found in books or spoken from a throne,
But whispered soft by wind through weathered trees,
These timeless secrets, to the heart made known,
Flow gentle as the murmur of the seas.

The wise have learned to listen more than speak,
To watch the dance of light on morning dew,
To find in simple things the answers soughtâ€”
That wisdom dwells not in the bold and sleek,
But in the quiet soul that remains true
To deeper truths that cannot be bought.
