Above the darkened earth, bright diamonds gleam,
Each stellar point a beacon in the night,
Their ancient fire fulfills the cosmic dream
Of souls who seek the source of endless light.

Through centuries they've watched our world below,
Silent guardians of time's eternal dance,
Their radiance helps wandering spirits grow
And offers hope to those who dare to chance.

The constellations tell their ageless tales
Of heroes, myths, and legends carved in sky,
While starlight through the cosmic darkness sails
To reach the hearts of dreamers such as I.

In brilliant patterns etched across the dome,
These stellar messengers guide wanderers home.
