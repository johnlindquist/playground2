Beyond the veil of earthbound sight they gleam,
Those ancient fires that pierce the cosmic dark,
Each stellar voice a messenger, a dream
That travels eons to ignite the spark
Of wonder in our mortal, searching eyes.
What secrets do these distant beacons hold?
What stories written in celestial skies
By hands that shaped the universe of old?
They whisper truths across the void of space,
In languages of light and gravity,
Of birth and death, of time's eternal race,
And mysteries that set the spirit free.
Though we are dust beneath their blazing choir,
We share with them the same primordial fire.
