In slumber's realm where phantom whispers roam,
Through corridors of night, the spirit flies,
Beyond the veil of flesh and earthly home,
To dance beneath the starlit dreaming skies.

Here memories and hopes in union blend,
As silver threads weave patterns yet unseen,
Where time's constraints and logic gently bend,
And all that was and might be dwells serene.

The dreamer walks through gardens made of thought,
Where flowers bloom with colors yet unnamed,
Each petal holds the wisdom that is sought,
Each fragrance tells of souls that can't be tamed.

So deep within this ethereal domain,
The sleeping mind finds what the day can't claim.
