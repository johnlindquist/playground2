In velvet darkness, diamonds pierce the night,
Each stellar beacon tells a tale untold,
Of distant worlds beyond our earthly sight,
Where cosmic mysteries eternally unfold.

The constellations dance in silent grace,
Their ancient light has traveled countless years,
To reach us here in this forgotten place,
And whisper secrets only heaven hears.

What stories do these burning giants keep?
What dreams are born in nebulae's embrace?
While mortals slumber in their restless sleep,
The universe reveals its boundless face.

So when you gaze upon the starlit dome,
Remember you are stardust, you are home.
