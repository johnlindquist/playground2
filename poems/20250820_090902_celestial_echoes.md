Above the world where mortal shadows dance,
The stars unfold their ancient, silent song,
Each pinprick light holds worlds beyond our glance,
Where time itself flows differently and long.

In constellations carved by cosmic hands,
The universe writes stories yet untold,
While galaxies drift through celestial lands,
Their silver threads worth more than earthly gold.

What secrets do these distant beacons keep?
What dreams are born in stellar nurseries?
As night unfolds and weary mortals sleep,
The stars conduct their endless symphonies.

Though we are small beneath this vast expanse,
We share with stars this fleeting, sacred dance.
