Beyond the veil of midnight's gentle embrace,
Where ancient light travels through cosmic years,
A thousand suns illuminate time and space,
Their distant radiance dissolving mortal fears.

Each pinprick gleam tells stories yet untold,
Of worlds unknown and galaxies far away,
Where stellar fires burn with light pure as gold,
And darkness yields to dawn's eternal day.

Through telescopes we glimpse infinity,
Those blazing orbs that guide the wanderer's path,
Their silent songs speak of divinity,
While we stand small beneath their shining wrath.

Yet in their light we find our deepest truth:
That we are made of stars, eternal youth.
