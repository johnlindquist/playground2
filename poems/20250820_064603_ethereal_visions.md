Within the realm where shadows softly dance,
And whispered secrets float on midnight air,
Dreams weave their tapestry of strange romance,
While slumbering minds drift free from earthly care.

Through corridors of thought, we gently roam,
Past memories that shimmer, fade, and gleam,
In landscapes built of hope, we find our home,
Where reality dissolves like morning steam.

The ethereal visions call us near,
With voices that no waking ear can hear,
They paint the sky with colors yet unknown,
And plant the seeds of futures yet unsown.

So let us treasure these nocturnal flights,
Where dreams transform our darkness into light.
