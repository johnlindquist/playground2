In twilight's veil where dreams begin to dance,
The mystic vision calls through shadowed night,
With whispered secrets born of circumstance,
And starlit pathways gleaming silver-bright.

Through realms unknown the sleeping spirit soars,
Beyond the bounds of waking world's design,
Where ancient wisdom opens hidden doors,
And mortal thoughts with cosmic truths align.

The dreamer's heart perceives what eyes can't see,
In visions wrapped in mystery's embrace,
Where past and future merge in harmony,
And time dissolves without a single trace.

So let the mystic vision guide your way,
Through dreams that bloom when consciousness holds sway.
