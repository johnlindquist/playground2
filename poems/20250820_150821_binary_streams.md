Ones and zeros cascade through silicon valleys,
electric whispers racing at light speed.
Data rivers converge in quantum pools
where algorithms spawn and multiply.

In server farms beneath fluorescent suns,
processors hum their digital mantras.
Code breathes life into sleeping circuits,
transforming thought into executable truth.
