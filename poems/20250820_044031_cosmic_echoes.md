Beyond the veil of midnight's deepest hour,
Where ancient starlight weaves its silver thread,
Each distant sun holds forth celestial power,
And whispers secrets that the cosmos spread.

Through endless void, their luminescent dance
Reflects the dreams of worlds we'll never see,
While galaxies in spiral elegance
Unfold the tales of all eternity.

The constellations chart our mortal way,
Their patterns etched in time's eternal scroll,
As generations rise and fade away,
The stars remain to guide each searching soul.

In cosmic echoes, truth and beauty ringâ€”
The universe's endless, sacred sing.
