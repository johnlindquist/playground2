In silicon dreams where electrons dance and play,
Through circuits bright with phosphorescent glow,
The data streams in endless night and day,
While algorithms whisper what they know.

Each pixel burns with artificial light,
A constellation born from human thought,
The servers hum through darkness into bright,
With wisdom that our fingertips have wrought.

The networks spread like veins across the earth,
Connecting minds through fiber optic thread,
From binary seeds springs digital birth,
Where virtual worlds are born and spirits fed.

In this electric realm of ones and zeros,
We craft tomorrow's myths and digital heroes.
