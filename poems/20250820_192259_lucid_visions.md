In the theater of sleep,
where logic dissolves into mist,
I navigate corridors of memory
that bend and shift like liquid light.

Faces emerge from shadowâ€”
some familiar, some phantoms
born of neural electricity,
each carrying whispers of tomorrow.

The dreamer and the dream
become indistinguishable,
reality a forgotten shore
beyond these infinite waters.
