Beyond the veil where mortal vision ends,
A billion lights pierce through the cosmic night,
Each stellar flame its ancient message sends
Across the void with everlasting light.

The constellations dance in patterns old,
While newborn stars ignite in distant space,
Their nuclear hearts burn fierce and bright and bold,
Illuminating time's eternal face.

From dust and gas these luminous orbs form,
Through gravity's embrace and fusion's fire,
They shine beyond each earthly storm,
Fulfilling their celestial desire.

In infinite expanse they'll ever gleam,
The universe's most enduring dream.
