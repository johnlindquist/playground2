Beneath the crimson sky, the ocean burns,
With waves that dance in scarlet morning light,
As ancient currents twist and twist and turn,
Through depths where coral dreams bloom red and bright.

The tide retreats, revealing shells of gold,
That whisper secrets from the ocean floor,
Where mermaids' songs and sailors' tales are told,
In chambers deep behind each coral door.

The crimson fade gives way to azure blue,
As day awakens from her scarlet sleep,
And seabirds cry their welcome to the new,
While waves caress the shore in rhythms deep.

The ocean holds all mysteries within,
Where every ending lets new life begin.
