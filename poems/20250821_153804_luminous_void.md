In darkness vast where ancient starlight gleams,
A void adorned with diamonds bright and cold,
Each distant sun fulfills celestial dreams,
While stories of the universe unfold.

Through endless night the stellar chorus sings,
A symphony of light across the dark,
Where gravity and cosmic motion brings
New worlds to birth with every stellar spark.

The luminous void calls out to mortal eyes,
Its beauty harsh yet tender as a prayer,
Where time itself in stellar cycles dies,
And reborn worlds dance through the cosmic air.

In this bright darkness, hope and wonder meetâ€”
The void made luminous, profound, complete.
