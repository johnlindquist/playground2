In cosmic depths where ancient starlight gleams,
A beacon burns through endless void of night,
Its silver fire transcends our mortal dreams,
And guides us through the darkness with its light.

From distant realms beyond our earthly sphere,
This celestial torch has watched civilizations rise,
Through countless ages, shining bright and clear,
A sentinel that never dims or dies.

What secrets does this stellar guardian hold?
What mysteries lie within its burning core?
Perhaps the answers to questions yet untold,
Or wisdom from the ages long before.

So let us gaze upon this beacon bright,
And find our path within its sacred light.
