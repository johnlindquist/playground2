Above the earth where mortals dream and sleep,
A thousand stars in silent vigil stand,
Their ancient light cuts through the darkness deep,
Like diamonds scattered by a master's hand.

Each beacon burns with stories yet untold,
Of galaxies beyond our fleeting sight,
Their radiance transcends both new and old,
A cosmic symphony of endless light.

Through eons past they've watched our world revolve,
Unmoved by time or earthly wars below,
While we look up and wonder to resolve
The mysteries their distant sparkles show.

O stars that shine through night's eternal reign,
Your light reminds us beauty shall remain.
