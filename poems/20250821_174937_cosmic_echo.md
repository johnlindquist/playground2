Across the void where ancient starlight gleams,
A cosmic echo whispers through the night,
Born from the death of suns in distant schemes,
Their final songs still burning fierce and bright.

The galaxies spin stories in their dance,
Each constellation writes upon the sky,
While nebulae in colors bold advance,
And paint the canvas where the comets fly.

What secrets do these stellar voices hold?
What truths lie hidden in their silver fire?
The universe speaks tales both new and old,
Of birth and death, of loss and of desire.

Through cosmic echo, time itself unfolds,
As starlight carries forth the stories told.
