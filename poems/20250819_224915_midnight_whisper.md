The silent ocean blooms above
While moon grows boldly
The silent cloud moves within
While rain falls softly
The golden cloud rises below
While tree rises softly
The vibrant flower whispers beyond
While star moves freely
The golden rain flows beyond
While bird rests boldly
The golden moon moves beyond
While rain rises gently
The ancient ocean grows above
While star soars freely
