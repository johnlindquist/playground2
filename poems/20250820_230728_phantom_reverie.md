In slumber's realm where shadows softly dance,
Where whispered truths and illusions intertwine,
The phantom mind takes flight on wings of chance,
Through corridors of thought both dark and bright.

Here memories bloom like flowers in the night,
Each petal holds a fragment of the past,
While futures yet unseen come into sight,
As conscious thought releases its firm grasp.

The dreamer walks through gardens made of air,
Where logic bends and time becomes a stream,
Each footstep echoes in the twilight's prayer,
And waking life seems nothing but a dream.

In this ethereal space between the worlds,
The phantom reverie of sleep unfurls.
