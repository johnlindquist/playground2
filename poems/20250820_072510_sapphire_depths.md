Beneath the waves where sapphire shadows dance,
The ancient currents weave their mystic song,
Through coral cities lost to time's advance,
Where forgotten treasures silently belong.

The moonlight pierces through the liquid veil,
Illuminating secrets of the deep,
While whales sing stories that will never fail
To wake the dreams that in the darkness sleep.

Here silver schools of fish like stars collide,
In endless ballet through the azure sphere,
Where pressure builds and mighty forces hide
The truths that surface dwellers never hear.

O sapphire depths, your mysteries unfold,
In liquid poems more precious than gold.
