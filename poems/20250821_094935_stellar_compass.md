Beyond the veil of night's eternal shroud,
The stellar compass points to distant light,
Where ancient suns in silence burn so proud,
Their whispered songs illuminate the night.

Each glowing orb a beacon in the dark,
Guiding souls through cosmic depths unknown,
Their silver fire leaves its timeless mark
On hearts that seek what heaven has sown.

The constellation maps our mortal way,
Through galaxies that spiral without end,
Where starlight holds the secrets of the day
And cosmic truths with earthbound dreams blend.

In stellar compass we find hope anew,
As infinite light guides us ever true.
