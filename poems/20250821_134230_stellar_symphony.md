Above the earth, a cosmic choir sings,
Each star a note in heaven's endless score,
While constellations spread their silver wings
And dance across the night's eternal shore.

The ancient light of distant suns cascades
Through space and time to reach our eager eyes,
As nebulae weave their celestial shades
And paint their stories on the midnight skies.

Orion stands with belt of diamonds bright,
While Polaris holds her steadfast place,
The Milky Way unfolds its river of light
Across the vast expanse of infinite space.

In stellar symphony, the cosmos calls,
Where wonder rises and the darkness falls.
