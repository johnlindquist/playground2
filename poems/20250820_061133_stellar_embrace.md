Beyond the veil of earthly night they gleam,
These ancient lights that pierce the cosmic dark,
Each stellar fire a long-forgotten dream
That burns eternal, leaving its bright mark.

In constellations carved by time's slow hand,
They weave their stories through the endless void,
While planets dance to rhythms they command,
And galaxies in silence are deployed.

Their light has traveled countless years to reach
Our waiting eyes that hunger for their glow,
These stellar messengers that gently teach
The secrets that the universe would show.

In stellar embrace, we find our place serene,
Connected to all that was and all unseen.
