Above the sleeping earth, the stars convene,
Their ancient light traversing time and space,
Each point of fire a witness to the scene
Of countless worlds that dance with subtle grace.

The constellations tell their silver tales,
Of heroes born from myths and mortal dreams,
While cosmic winds fill vast celestial sails,
And starlight weaves through darkness, bright it gleams.

In silence deep, they watch our fleeting years,
These distant suns that burn with patient flame,
They've seen empires rise, and shed no tears
For all that changes, all that stays the same.

Forever burning in the velvet night,
Stars echo truths beyond our earthly sight.
