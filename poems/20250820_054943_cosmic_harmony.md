Beyond the veil of earthly sight they gleam,
Those ancient fires that pierce the endless night,
Each stellar voice joins heaven's sacred dream,
A symphony of pure celestial light.

In constellations mapped by souls of old,
The universe reveals its hidden song,
Where galaxies their timeless stories told
To wanderers who searched for right from wrong.

Through darkness vast, their radiance extends,
A beacon for the lost, the brave, the true,
As starlight with our mortal vision blends,
And shows us worlds both ancient and brand new.

    So let us lift our eyes to heaven's dome,
    And find in stars our everlasting home.
