Above the world in diamond fields they dwell,
Ancient fires that pierce the veil of night,
Each point of brilliance holds a sacred spell,
Weaving stories in celestial light.

Through cosmic ages they have watched and burned,
Silent witnesses to time's endless flow,
Their distant songs to earthbound hearts have turned,
Teaching truths that mortals long to know.

In stellar dance they chart infinity,
Mapping dreams across the boundless void,
Their radiance speaks of life's divinity,
Where hope and wonder never are destroyed.

O stars that guide us through our darkest hours,
Your light reveals our hidden cosmic powers.
