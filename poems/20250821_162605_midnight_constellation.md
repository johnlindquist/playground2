Above the silent earth, a canvas vast and deep,
Where diamonds scattered shine through velvet night,
Each star a beacon that the darkness cannot keep
From casting down its pure celestial light.

The constellations weave their ancient lore,
Their patterns etched in fire across the sky,
While mortals gaze and wonder evermore
At mysteries that dance in realms so high.

Orion stands with sword and shield held high,
The Dipper pours its light on sleeping towns,
As shooting stars in brilliant arcs they fly,
Like wishes written into starlit crowns.

In midnight's embrace, these guardians gleam,
Eternal sentinels of human dream.
