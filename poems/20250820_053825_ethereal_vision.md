In twilight's gentle embrace I find my way,
Through corridors of sleep where visions dwell,
Where phantom lights and shadows softly play,
And whispered secrets only dreams can tell.

The mind unfolds like petals in the night,
Each thought a star that glimmers, fades, and gleams,
While consciousness dissolves in liquid light,
And reality surrenders to our dreams.

Here time becomes a river flowing free,
Where past and future merge in golden streams,
And all that was and all that's yet to be
Dance together in our sacred dreams.

So close your eyes and let the vision start,
Dreams are the windows to the sleeping heart.
