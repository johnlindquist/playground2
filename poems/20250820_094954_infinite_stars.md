In cosmic depths where ancient starlight gleams,
A billion suns dance through the endless night,
Each burning ember holds eternal dreams
And casts its silver radiance so bright.

The constellations weave their tales of old,
While galaxies spiral in majestic arc,
Their distant fires burn both fierce and bold
To guide lost souls through realms forever dark.

Time flows like stardust through the vast expanse,
As nebulae birth worlds we'll never see,
And in this grand celestial romance
We find our place in all eternity.

    Though small we stand beneath the starry dome,
    We're made of starsâ€”the universe our home.
