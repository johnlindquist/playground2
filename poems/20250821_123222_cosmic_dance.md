Above the world where mortals dream and sleep,
A billion points of light begin their show,
Each stellar flame a promise they will keep
To dance through darkness with celestial glow.

In silence vast, they waltz across the night,
Their ancient choreography unfolds,
While galaxies spin weaving threads of light,
And cosmic secrets never quite retold.

The constellations tell their storied past,
Of heroes bold and lovers torn apart,
Their luminous tales forever meant to last
Written in fire across the sky's dark heart.

So when you gaze upon the starlit dome,
Remember you're witnessing their eternal home.
