In midnight's realm where stellar fires gleam,
A cascade falls of light through cosmic space,
Each distant sun fulfills its destined dream,
While constellations dance with timeless grace.

The ancient stories written in their glow,
Tell tales of worlds beyond our earthbound sight,
Where galaxies in endless spirals flow,
And nebulae paint colors burning bright.

O luminous cascade of stellar flame,
You guide lost souls through darkness of the night,
Your radiance shall ever be the same,
A beacon born of pure celestial light.

In starlit depths where infinity resides,
Your luminous cascade forever guides.
