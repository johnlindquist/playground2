In slumber's realm where shadows softly play,
The mystic echo calls through twilight's veil,
Where dreams unfold like petals at the day,
And whispered truths through starlight winds prevail.

Through corridors of sleep we gently roam,
Where memory and fantasy entwine,
In realms beyond our conscious earthly home,
Where mortal thoughts with divine visions combine.

The echo speaks in languages unknown,
Of futures past and presents yet to be,
In dreamscapes where the seeds of truth are sown,
And souls dance wild and forever free.

So listen close when night's embrace draws near,
The mystic echo has much for you to hear.
