Beyond the veil of darkness, diamonds gleam,
Each stellar light a promise in the night,
Their ancient songs awaken mortal dream,
And fill the cosmos with eternal bright.

From distant suns to nebulae that swirl,
The universe unfolds its sacred art,
While constellations dance and slowly whirl,
Each burning sphere a beat within time's heart.

Through eons past and futures yet unseen,
These beacons guide the wanderer's weary soul,
Their radiance eternal, pure, serene,
A testament that fragments make a whole.

So when the earthbound gaze upon the sky,
They glimpse infinity that will not die.
