In velvet depths where ancient starlight gleams,
A constellation writes its silver tale,
Each point of light a guardian of dreams,
Where cosmic winds through endless darkness sail.

The diamonds scattered on night's endless cloth
Tell stories older than the earth below,
While mortals gaze with wonder mixed with wroth
At mysteries they'll never fully know.

Yet in that darkness burns a gentle fire,
A beacon calling souls to look above,
Where stellar dust fulfills its grand desire
To guide the wandering hearts in search of love.

So let the velvet constellation shine,
Its timeless beauty ever more divine.
