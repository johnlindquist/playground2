Beneath the waves where ancient secrets sleep,
The ocean holds its breath in silence vast,
While currents weave through trenches dark and deep,
And tidal dreams flow forward from the past.

The coral gardens dance in liquid light,
Where seahorses drift through gardens of the blue,
And jellyfish pulse soft through endless night,
Their ghostly forms in waters crystal-true.

Here whales sing songs that span the hemispheres,
Their melodies echo through the liquid dome,
While pearls are born from centuries of tears,
In caverns that the surface never roam.

The ocean keeps its mysteries below,
Where depths reveal what only currents know.
