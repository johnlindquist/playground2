In the theater of sleep, curtains fall
While consciousness surrenders to shadow,
Fragments of tomorrow dance with yesterday,
Weaving tapestries from forgotten wishes.

Behind closed lids, impossible cities rise,
Where gravity bends to the dreamer's will,
And time becomes a river flowing backwards
Through landscapes painted in starlight.
