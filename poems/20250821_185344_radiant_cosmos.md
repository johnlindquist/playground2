In distant reaches where the starlight gleams,
A thousand suns burn bright against the night,
Each constellation weaving silver dreams
Through velvet darkness with celestial light.

The cosmos spins in patterns vast and deep,
Where nebulae like gardens bloom in space,
And ancient light through eons seems to leap
To touch our world with its ethereal grace.

What mysteries lie hidden in those spheres?
What worlds unknown dance 'round those distant flames?
The universe expands beyond our years,
Yet calls to us through starlight's whispered names.

So look above when darkness fills the skyâ€”
The radiant cosmos sings its lullaby.
