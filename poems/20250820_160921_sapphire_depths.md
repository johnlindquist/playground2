Beneath the waves where sapphire currents flow,
In depths where ancient secrets softly dwell,
The ocean's heart beats strong and deep below,
With tales that only coral kingdoms tell.

Through liquid blue, the sunlight filters down,
Creating prisms in the crystal sea,
Where silver schools of fish in silence crown
The underwater realm's serenity.

Here mermaids once sang lullabies so sweet,
To sailors lost in storms above the foam,
While tidal forces make the waters meet
In rhythms that have called this place their home.

    The sapphire depths hold mysteries untold,
    In liquid treasures worth much more than gold.
