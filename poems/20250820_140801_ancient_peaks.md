Against the sky they rise in majesty,
These ancient peaks that pierce the morning mist,
Stone sentinels of earth's vast history,
By wind and time eternally kissed.

Their granite faces catch the golden light,
While shadows dance in valleys far below,
Each ridge a fortress built by nature's might,
Where wildflowers in alpine meadows grow.

Through seasons they endure, through storm and calm,
These monuments that dwarf our fleeting days,
Their silence speaks a universal psalm
Of patience written in stone's endless ways.

In their presence, human hearts find peace,
Where earthbound worries find their sweet release.
