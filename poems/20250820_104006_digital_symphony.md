Lines of light cascade through silicon dreams,
Where algorithms dance in binary streams.
Functions whisper secrets to the void,
While variables hold truths yet unexployed.

Compilers breathe life into syntax pure,
Transforming thoughts to logic clean and sure.
In this realm where zeros meet the ones,
A digital symphony softly runs.
