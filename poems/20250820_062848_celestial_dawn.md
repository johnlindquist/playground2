When darkness yields to morning's gentle call,
The stars retreat like diamonds in the sky,
Their silver light begins to fade and fall
As dawn approaches with its golden eye.

Each twinkling point, a beacon from afar,
Has watched through night with ancient, steady glow,
A cosmic dance where every burning star
Tells stories that the sleeping earth below

Will never hear in daylight's rushing pace.
But those who rise before the sun appears
Can witness this celestial embrace
Between the fading night and morning's tears.

So let us pause and honor what we've seenâ€”
The stellar bridge 'tween darkness and serene.
