Above the restless world, celestial guides
Pierce through the veil of night with ancient light,
Each distant sun a beacon that provides
Direction to the wanderer in flight.
The North Star holds its station, firm and true,
While constellations wheel in grand design,
Their silver paths trace stories old yet new
Of lovers lost and heroes made divine.
In cosmic dance they spin through endless space,
Each twinkle speaks of worlds beyond our reach,
Yet still they offer solace and their grace
To every soul their radiance can teach.
When earthly compass fails and hope grows dim,
Look upâ€”the stars will guide you back to Him.
