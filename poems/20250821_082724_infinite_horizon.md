Beyond the veil of earthbound sight extends
A canvas vast where stellar fires dance,
Each distant sun its ancient light transcends
Through cosmic void in timeless, silent trance.

The infinite horizon calls to those
Who dare to dream of worlds beyond our own,
Where stellar winds through nebulae compose
A symphony in languages unknown.

Across the darkness, constellations weave
Their stories told in silver threads of light,
While mortal hearts in wonder do believe
In mysteries that pierce the endless night.

Though bound to earth, our spirits ever yearn
For distant stars where cosmic fires burn.
