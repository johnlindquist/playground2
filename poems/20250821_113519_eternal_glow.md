Above the world where earthbound sorrows fade,
Ten thousand diamonds pierce the velvet night,
Each stellar flame a promise heaven made,
To guide the lost with everlasting light.

Through cosmic depths where silence holds its court,
These ancient fires burn with patient grace,
While mortals sleep, the stars their vigil sport,
And weave bright patterns through time's endless space.

O distant suns that ruled before my birth,
Your radiance spans millennia untold,
Yet still you shine upon this spinning earth,
With wisdom worth far more than silver-gold.

When I am dust, your flames will still burn bright,
Eternal guardians of the endless night.
