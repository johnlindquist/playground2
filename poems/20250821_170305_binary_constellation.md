In circuits deep where silicon dreams reside,
Where data flows like starlight through the night,
Each bit and byte a beacon, burning bright,
As algorithms dance where worlds collide.

The servers hum their electronic hymn,
While processors compute the endless stream,
Of ones and zeros building up a dream,
Where artificial minds begin to brim.

Through fiber optic cables, signals race,
Connecting distant nodes across the sphere,
As quantum gates unlock a new frontier,
And machine learning charts uncharted space.

In this binary constellation's glow,
We glimpse tomorrow's seeds that we shall sow.
