Upon the ancient peaks where eagles soar,
Through misted valleys carved by time's own hand,
The granite sentries stand forevermore,
As guardians of this timeless, sacred land.

Their shoulders bear the weight of endless years,
While seasons paint their faces white with snow,
They listen to the wind's forgotten fears,
And watch the rivers in the valleys flow.

In silence they have witnessed rise and fall,
Of empires built on dreams and turned to dust,
These mountain kings, the noblest ones of all,
Stand witness to what was, and what we must.

So when we seek the truth in morning's light,
We climb toward peaks that pierce the infinite.
