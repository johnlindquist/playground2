Beyond the veil of earthbound dreams,
Ten thousand lights pierce the darkness,
Each one a story untold, a world unborn,
Scattered like diamond dust across eternity's canvas.

In their silent symphony of light,
We find our smallness and our wonder,
Connected by the same ancient fire
That burns in hearts and distant suns.
