Upon the ancient peaks where eagles soar,
Stone sentinels stand guard through endless time,
Their weathered faces tell of days of yore,
When earth itself was young and in its prime.

Through mist and cloud they pierce the morning sky,
Silent witnesses to the world below,
Where mortals pass like shadows hurrying by,
While mountains endure through sun and snow.

What secrets do these granite giants keep?
What stories carved in cliff and craggy wall?
They've watched the centuries slowly creep,
Unmoved by rise of empires or their fall.

These ancient peaks shall outlast all our days,
Eternal monuments to time's long maze.
