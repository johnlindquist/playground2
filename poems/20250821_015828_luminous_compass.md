Above the world where earthbound hearts reside,
A thousand points of light pierce through the night,
Each stellar flame a beacon, burning bright,
To lead the lost and weary far and wide.
The ancient navigators turned their eyes
To constellations mapped in silver thread,
Where Polaris held its station overhead,
A faithful sentinel in starlit skies.
Though cities blur the heavens with their glow,
And progress dims the cosmic ballet's dance,
Still starlight finds a way to guide and show
The paths that lead beyond mere circumstance.
  In darkness when all earthly compasses fail,
  The stars remainâ€”our luminous, true trail.
