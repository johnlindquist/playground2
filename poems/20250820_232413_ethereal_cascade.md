In realms where consciousness grows thin and pale,
Where thoughts dissolve like mist on morning's breath,
The dreamer walks through valleys without trail,
Beyond the boundaries of life and death.

Each vision flows like water down a hill,
Cascading through the chambers of the mind,
Where time stands silent, motion becomes still,
And fragments of forgotten truths we find.

The ethereal cascade of sleeping thought
Weaves patterns that the waking eye can't see,
A tapestry of all that can't be taught,
Where souls drift weightless, wild, and truly free.

In dreams we touch the infinite unknown,
And find ourselves in worlds we've never grown.
