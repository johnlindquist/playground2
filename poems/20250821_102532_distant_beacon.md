In the vast expanse where silence reigns,
A single star burns through eternal night,
Its ancient light traversing endless space
To find us here, waiting beneath the dome of dreams.

What stories does it carry from distant worlds?
What whispers of time before memory began?
This distant beacon calls across the voidâ€”
A promise that we are not alone.
