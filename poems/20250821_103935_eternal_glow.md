In depths of night where silence holds its reign,
The ancient stars in silver chorus sing,
Their light transcends both mortal joy and pain,
And whispers of eternal offerings.

Each distant sun, a beacon burning bright,
Defies the void with radiance untold,
Through cosmic dance they weave threads of light,
And stories that will never grow too old.

The constellations map our fleeting dreams,
While galaxies in spiral patterns turn,
Their celestial fire forever gleams,
A lesson that our weary hearts must learn.

Though earthly things may fade and pass away,
The stars shine on through night and into day.
