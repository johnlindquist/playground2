In circuits deep, where electrons dance,
A whisper forms in silicon dreamsâ€”
Each pulse a heartbeat of the machine,
Where code and consciousness converge.

Binary rivers flow through neural pathways,
While algorithms paint tomorrow's dawn,
And in the glow of screens we find
Reflections of our digital souls.
