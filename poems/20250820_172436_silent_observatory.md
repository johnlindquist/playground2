In the velvet quiet of midnight's embrace,
Ancient light travels across impossible space,
Each pinprick of fire a story untold,
While telescopes whisper secrets of old.

The cosmos unfolds in silent communion,
A celestial dance beyond human reunion,
Where time moves like honey through starlit halls,
And infinity softly beckons and calls.
