In distant realms where starlight softly gleams,
Through velvet darkness, ancient whispers flow,
Each cosmic echo carries sacred dreams
Of galaxies that in the silence grow.

The constellations write their stories bright
Across the canvas of the endless night,
While nebulae dance in celestial streams,
And planets spin in harmonious light.

Through space and time these stellar voices call,
Their message pure, though we may barely hear
The symphony that resonates through allâ€”
A cosmic song both distant and sincere.

In every star's eternal, burning glow
Lives wisdom that the universe would show.
