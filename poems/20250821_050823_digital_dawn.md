In silicon valleys where the circuits dream,
Electric pulses weave through metal veins,
While algorithms dance in data streams,
And quantum whispers break traditional chains.

The servers hum their binary lullaby,
As networks spread like neural pathways bright,
Through fiber optic cables, bits can fly
At speeds that blur the boundary of light.

Code poets craft in languages divine,
Their syntax flowing like a river's course,
While artificial minds begin to shine
With sparks of consciousness, a new-born force.

In this digital dawn, we stand between
The age-old world and futures yet unseen.
