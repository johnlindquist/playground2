Beneath the waves where emerald waters flow,
And sunlight dances through the crystal deep,
The ocean's secrets whisper soft and slow,
While ancient currents their eternal sweep.

The coral gardens bloom in silent grace,
Where fish like jewels dart through liquid light,
And in this vast, enchanted underwater space,
Time flows beyond the reach of day and night.

Here mysteries of ages past reside,
In trenches dark where no explorer goes,
The ocean holds what land and sky would hide,
A world of wonder that forever grows.

So deep the emerald depths call out to me,
A realm of endless possibility.
