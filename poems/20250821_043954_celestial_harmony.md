Above the earthbound realm where mortals dwell,
A symphony of stars begins to play,
Each distant sun a note that seems to swell
Through cosmic halls of night and break of day.
The constellation's dance, both old and true,
Weaves melodies across the velvet sky,
While galaxies spin forth in hues of blue
And silver streams that never seem to die.
In perfect time, the planets keep their beat,
As comets trace their ancient, fiery arc,
This celestial choir, both pure and sweet,
Illuminates the corners of the dark.
So let us listen to this starry song,
That echoes through eternity, lifelong.
