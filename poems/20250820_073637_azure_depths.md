Beneath the surface where the sunlight fades,
Azure waters hold their ancient secrets deep,
Where currents dance in underwater glades,
And coral kingdoms their eternal vigil keep.

The whales sing songs of depths beyond our sight,
Their melodies echo through the boundless blue,
While phosphorescent creatures paint the night
With living stars that glow in ocean's hue.

Down where the pressure builds and darkness reigns,
Strange forms of life adapt and slowly thrive,
The ocean's heart beats strong through all its veins,
Keeping the planet's deepest dreams alive.

In azure depths where mysteries never cease,
The ocean cradles Earth's eternal peace.
