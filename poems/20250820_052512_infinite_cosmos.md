Beyond the veil of earthly night they gleam,
These ancient lights that pierce the cosmic deep,
Where galaxies in spiral dances dream
And stellar fires their vigil ever keep.

Each pinpoint holds a world of burning might,
A furnace forged in time's primordial birth,
Their radiance spans the void with silver light
To reach across the silence to our Earth.

What secrets do these distant suns contain?
What worlds revolve in their celestial sphere?
Through telescope we glimpse their bright domain
Yet mysteries remain forever near.

O infinite expanse of starlit space,
You hold us in your vast, eternal grace.
