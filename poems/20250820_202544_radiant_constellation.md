Above the earthly realm where shadows fall,
A radiant constellation burns so bright,
Each stellar gem responds to heaven's call,
And paints the velvet canvas of the night.

The ancient light that traveled countless years
Now whispers secrets from the cosmic deep,
While mortal eyes shed wonder-stricken tears
At beauty that makes earthbound spirits weep.

Through spacetime's vast and infinite expanse,
These distant suns perform their timeless dance,
Their nuclear hearts beat rhythms pure and true,
Creating elements both old and new.

O radiant stars that pierce the darkest veil,
Your light shall burn when all else grows pale.
