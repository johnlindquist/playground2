In slumber's realm where whispered visions dwell,
Beyond the veil of waking consciousness,
Where midnight's secrets quietly compel
The soul to dance in dreamlike tenderness.

Through corridors of thought and memory's lane,
Where shadows speak in languages unknown,
The dreamer walks through pleasure and through pain,
In worlds that seedling imagination's sown.

Each fleeting scene, a fragment of the mind,
Unfolds like petals in the morning dew,
Where logic's chains are left so far behind,
And anything the heart desires comes true.

So let us cherish these nocturnal flights,
Where dreams illuminate our darkest nights.
