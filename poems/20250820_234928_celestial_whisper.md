Above the earth where silence reigns supreme,
A thousand points of light pierce through the night,
Each star a distant world, a cosmic dream,
That speaks in tongues of silver, gold, and white.

The constellations trace their ancient lore,
While planets dance in their celestial waltz,
Through space and time they've wandered, as before,
Their whispered secrets held in starlit vaults.

The universe unfolds its endless page,
Where galaxies like flowers bloom and fade,
Each twinkling star a witness to our age,
A testament to wonders ever made.

In cosmic silence, stars their stories tell,
Of mysteries that time alone knows well.
