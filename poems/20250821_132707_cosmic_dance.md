In velvet darkness, ancient lights unfold,
Their silver whispers pierce the endless night,
Each burning sphere a story to be told,
A cosmic ballet bathed in sacred light.

The constellations weave their timeless song,
Through galaxies that spiral without end,
Where stellar winds have blown for ages long,
And space and time in harmony transcend.

These distant suns, like diamonds in the void,
Remind us of our place within the whole,
That though our earthly forms may be destroyed,
We share the fire that burns in every soul.

So when I gaze upon this starlit dome,
I find in cosmic dance my truest home.
