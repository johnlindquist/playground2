Above the world where mortals dream and sleep,
The stellar choir sings in silent light,
Each distant sun a promise burning bright
Across the vast celestial ocean deep.

Their whispered songs through cosmic darkness creep,
And paint the canvas of eternal night
With silver brushstrokes, delicate and light,
While earthbound souls their nightly vigil keep.

What secrets do these ancient beacons hold?
What stories in their twinkling eyes reside?
They've watched empires rise, grow weak, and old,

Yet still they burn with fires that never died.
In stellar whispers, truth and love unfoldâ€”
The universe's heart beats starry-wide.
