Above the world, where diamond fires burn,
In silence vast, the stellar chorus sings,
Each distant sun a beacon that will turn
The darkness into light on silver wings.

Through cosmic void, their ancient stories flow,
Of worlds unborn and galaxies long past,
While earthbound souls below can only know
A fraction of their brilliance unsurpassed.

Yet in their gleaming dance across the night,
They whisper secrets to the dreaming mind,
Of infinite expanse and endless flight
Beyond the bonds that keep us earthbound-kind.

So gaze upon their eternal displayâ€”
These stars that guide us through our mortal day.
