Above the world where silence holds its breath,
A thousand diamonds pierce the velvet night,
Each star a beacon conquering cold death,
Their ancient fire burns with steady light.

Through cosmic depths they dance in measured time,
While mortals sleep beneath their watchful gaze,
These sentinels of space, both pure and prime,
Have witnessed countless nights and countless days.

What secrets do these stellar guardians keep?
What stories written in their burning cores?
They shine on lovers' vows and children's sleep,
On ocean waves and distant mountain shores.

Though ages pass and empires rise and fall,
The stars remainâ€”eternal flames for all.
