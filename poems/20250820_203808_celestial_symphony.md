Above the earth, in darkness draped so deep,
A million points of light begin their dance,
Each star a note that makes the heavens weep
With beauty born of cosmic circumstance.

The constellations weave their ancient song,
Through galaxies that spiral without end,
Where supernovas blaze both bright and strong,
And stellar winds their silver music send.

In silence vast, this orchestra performs,
With planets as their audience below,
Through cosmic dust and interstellar storms,
They shine with fires that forever glow.

Though distance vast may keep us worlds apart,
Their light still reaches deep into the heart.
