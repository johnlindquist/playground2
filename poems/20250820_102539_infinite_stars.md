Above the world, a tapestry of light,
Where countless stars in silence dance and gleam,
Each distant sun burns with celestial might,
Illuminating every mortal dream.

Through endless void they scatter silver dust,
Ancient beacons from time's forgotten start,
Their radiance speaks of mysteries we trust,
Mapping the cosmos within the human heart.

Some flicker soft, while others blaze with fire,
Guiding lost souls through darkness of the night,
Their voices singing in celestial choir,
Transforming shadow into sacred sight.

In infinite expanse they tell their story,
Of timeless grace and everlasting glory.
