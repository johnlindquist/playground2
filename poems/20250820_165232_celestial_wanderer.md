Through endless void where cosmic winds do blow,
A wanderer drifts on currents made of light,
Past nebulae that pulse with silver glow,
And ancient suns that pierce eternal night.

Each stellar beacon tells a tale untold,
Of worlds that bloom beneath their warming rays,
Where life unfolds in patterns brave and bold,
Through countless nights and everlasting days.

The wanderer seeks no harbor, finds no rest,
But journeys on through galaxies unknown,
Forever bound by some celestial quest,
Through realms where mortal hearts have never flown.

In starlight's embrace, the truth is clear:
We're all just wanderers in this cosmic sphere.
