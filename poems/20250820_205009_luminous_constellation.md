Above the darkened canvas of the night,
A thousand diamonds pierce the velvet sky,
Each stellar flame a beacon burning bright,
While ancient stories in their patterns lie.
The constellation's dance through time unfolds,
As cosmic winds through stellar gardens blow,
Each twinkling star a secret tale that holds
Of worlds beyond what mortal eyes can know.
In silver threads they weave celestial lore,
Their radiance spans the vast eternal deep,
Through ages past and countless ages more,
They guard the dreams of those who lie asleep.
These luminous guardians of the sphere
Remind us that the infinite is near.
