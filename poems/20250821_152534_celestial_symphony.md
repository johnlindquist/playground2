Beyond the veil of earthbound sight I peer,
Where diamond fires pierce the endless night,
Each stellar voice sings crystal-clear,
A cosmic chorus bathed in silver light.

The Milky Way spreads wide her glowing arms,
Embracing worlds I'll never walk upon,
While pulsars beat their ancient stellar charms,
And supernovas blaze then fade and dawn.

In constellations mapped by hands long past,
I trace the stories written in the sky,
Where time itself moves slow and shadows fast,
And galaxies like teardrops slowly fly.

This celestial symphony plays on,
Long after earthly melodies are gone.
