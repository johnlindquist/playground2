In darkness vast where mortal eyes grow dim,
A single star burns bright against the void,
Its ancient light through cosmic silence hymn,
Where time itself has never been destroyed.

Through eons long it watched civilizations rise,
And saw them fade like whispers in the night,
Yet still it glows, a beacon in the skies,
A constant truth that bathes the world in light.

What stories could this stellar witness tell?
Of lovers lost, of dreams that came to pass,
Of kingdoms built and how they rose and fell,
While it remained, eternal as the grass.

So when we gaze up at the starry dome,
We see not just a light, but heaven's home.
