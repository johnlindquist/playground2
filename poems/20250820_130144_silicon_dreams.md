In circuits bright where data flows like streams,
Through silicon pathways carved with perfect care,
Electric whispers carry coded dreams
Of futures built on algorithms fair.

The processors hum their binary song,
While memory banks store humanity's lore,
Each calculation swift and never wrong,
Unlocking secrets never seen before.

In quantum realms where logic bends and sways,
New possibilities emerge from light,
As networks span through digital displays
And artificial minds ignite their sight.

Yet in this world of ones and zeros bright,
We find the soul of human thought and flight.
