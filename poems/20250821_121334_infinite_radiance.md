In cosmic depths where ancient starlight gleams,
A thousand suns cast forth their silver fire,
Each distant world fulfills celestial dreams,
As galaxies in spiral dance aspire.

The velvet void holds secrets yet untold,
While nebulae paint portraits in the night,
Their burning hearts scatter gems of gold
Across the endless canvas of pure light.

From earth we gaze at constellations bright,
These beacons guide our souls through time and space,
They whisper tales of wonder and of might,
And show us beauty's most eternal face.

In infinite radiance they forever shine,
These stellar guardians of the grand design.
