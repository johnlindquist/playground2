Above the earth where darkness softly falls,
A thousand points of light begin to gleam,
Each star a witness to our earthly dreams,
And ancient echoes through the cosmos calls.

The distant suns that pierce the velvet halls
Of infinite space with their celestial beam,
Are messengers of hope's eternal theme,
Where silence speaks and gentle starlight crawls.

Through centuries they've watched our world below,
These beacons bright that never cease to burn,
Their radiant fire sets the night aglow.

In their steadfast light, what truths we learn:
That even in the depths of darkest woe,
The stars remind us light will still return.
