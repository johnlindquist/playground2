In velvet darkness, stars begin to gleam,
Their ancient light across the cosmos streams,
Each distant sun a fragment of a dream,
That dances through the night's ethereal schemes.

The constellations tell their timeless tales,
Of heroes born from dust and stellar fire,
While cosmic winds fill infinity's sails,
And lift our earthbound souls ever higher.

Through telescopes we glimpse the vast unknown,
Where galaxies in spiral patterns turn,
Each twinkling point a world we've never known,
Yet in their light, our hearts forever yearn.

These celestial whispers from afar,
Remind us all how small, yet blessed, we are.
