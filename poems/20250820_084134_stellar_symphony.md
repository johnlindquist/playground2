Above the world, where darkness meets the light,
A thousand stars compose their ancient song,
Each gleaming note sustained throughout the night,
Their melodies have played for ages long.

The constellation's choir fills the sky,
With harmonies that pierce the cosmic veil,
While distant suns in perfect rhythm fly,
Their luminescent voices never fail.

Orion's belt strikes bass notes deep and true,
As Polaris holds the steady beat,
The Milky Way swirls patterns old yet new,
Where stellar symphonies and silence meet.

This celestial orchestra plays on,
Until the breaking of another dawn.
