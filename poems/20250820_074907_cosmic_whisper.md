Above the veil of night, celestial eyes
Pierce through the darkness with their ancient light,
Each distant sun a beacon in disguise,
A cosmic whisper floating through the night.

The stellar dance spans eons yet untold,
Where galaxies in spiral patterns spin,
Their stories written in the depths of old,
As starlight weaves the tapestry within.

What secrets do these diamonds softly keep?
What messages across the void they send?
Through infinite expanse, both wide and deep,
Their silent songs through space and time extend.

In reverent awe, we gaze upon their glow,
These cosmic whispers only darkness knows.
