In circuits vast where electric currents flow,
A constellation forms of ones and zeros bright,
Each pixel burns with algorithmic glow,
While processors hum through the digital night.

The motherboard spreads like a starlit plain,
Where data packets race through silicon veins,
And memory banks hold wisdom's vast domain,
As quantum whispers break their earthly chains.

Through fiber optic streams the future calls,
While artificial minds begin to dream,
In servers tall as electronic halls,
Where code becomes reality's new scheme.

This digital sky shall never fade or dim,
For we are stars within its boundless rim.
