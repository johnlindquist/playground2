Above the world where silence holds its reign,
The stars compose their ancient symphony,
Each point of light a note beyond all pain,
A cosmic song that speaks of mystery.

Through velvet darkness, melodies unfold,
As constellations dance in perfect time,
Their silver voices tell stories untold
Of birth and death in rhythm so sublime.

The Milky Way conducts with graceful sweep,
While planets hum in harmony below,
As galaxies their sacred music keep,
A chorus that through endless ages flow.

In starlit nights when earthbound troubles cease,
We hear the universe sing songs of peace.
