Across the cosmic void where starlight gleams,
A thousand suns ignite the endless night,
Each burning orb fulfills celestial dreams
And guides the lost with pure, eternal light.

Through galaxies that spiral without end,
These ancient fires dance in perfect time,
Their radiance through space and matter send
A symphony of reason and of rhyme.

What secrets do these distant beacons hold?
What stories from the dawn of time they tell?
In constellations new and legends old,
They weave the tales that mortals know so well.

So let us gaze upon their brilliant fire,
And find within their glow our hearts' desire.
