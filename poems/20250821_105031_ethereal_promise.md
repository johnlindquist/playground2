In realms where conscious thought surrenders hold,
And twilight paints the boundaries of mind,
Sweet visions dance through corridors untold,
Where logic sleeps and wonder is enshrined.
Each phantom hope takes wing on silver streams,
Through landscapes built of memory's soft clay,
While starlight weaves through tapestries of dreams,
And night becomes the architect of day.
In depths where earthly sorrows cannot reach,
The soul finds refuge in its sacred space,
Where whispered truths that daylight cannot teach
Illuminate the heart with gentle grace.
    So sleep becomes the promise we hold dear,
    That dreams will wash away each mortal fear.
