In cosmic depths where stellar fires burn bright,
A cascade flows of diamonds through the void,
Each twinkling point a beacon in the night,
Where ancient light and darkness are deployed.

The Milky Way spreads wide its silver streams,
While constellations dance in grand array,
Their radiance illuminates our dreams
And guides the lost through night into the day.

Above the earth these jewels softly gleam,
In patterns carved by time's relentless hand,
They whisper secrets of the vast supreme
And mysteries we struggle to understand.

O stellar cascade, eternal and free,
You are the universe's poetry.
