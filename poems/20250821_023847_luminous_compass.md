Above the vast expanse of midnight sky,
A thousand points of light begin to gleam,
Each distant star a beacon burning high,
To guide the wanderer through the cosmic dream.

The compass needle spins through starlit space,
While constellations map the ancient way,
Their silver threads weave stories time can't erase,
Of cosmic journeys from night into day.

Through galaxies that spiral without end,
The stellar lighthouse calls across the void,
Where light and darkness gracefully transcend
The mortal bonds that once could be destroyed.

So let the luminous compass be your guide,
Through infinite realms where starlight does abide.
