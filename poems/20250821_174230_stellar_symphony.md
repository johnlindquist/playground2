Across the midnight canvas, stars align,
Their ancient light weaves stories through the dark,
Each constellation speaks in verse divine,
While cosmic winds ignite the stellar spark.

The Milky Way unfurls its silver thread,
Through galaxies that dance in endless time,
Where newborn suns in stellar nurseries are bred,
And dying giants sing their last sublime.

In harmonies that span the void between,
These celestial bodies compose their song,
A symphony of light both felt and seen,
That echoes through the cosmos, pure and strong.

So let us listen to their timeless call,
For in their music, we find truth in all.
