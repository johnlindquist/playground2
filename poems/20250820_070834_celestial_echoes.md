Beyond the veil of earthbound sight they gleam,
Ancient guardians of the endless night,
Their silver whispers form a cosmic dream
That spans the void with threads of distant light.

Each point of fire holds a story vast,
Of worlds unborn and civilizations gone,
While constellations bridge the present, past,
And future tales in stellar light are drawn.

The universe speaks through their gentle glow,
In languages of photons, time, and space,
Teaching mortals all they need to know
About infinity's eternal grace.

So when we gaze upon their scattered dance,
We join the chorus of celestial trance.
