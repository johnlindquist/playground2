Above the earthly realm where mortals dwell,
A canvas stretched with diamonds bright and true,
Each stellar flame has ancient tales to tell
Of cosmic births and deaths in endless view.

The Pleiades dance in their ancient way,
While Orion stands guard through winter's night,
Polaris holds its course without delay,
A faithful beacon, steady in its light.

These burning suns, though distant and so far,
Connect our souls to mysteries unknown,
Each twinkling point a world, each world a star,
In patterns that for eons have been sown.

So when the darkness falls and daylight ends,
Look up and see how starlight transcends.
