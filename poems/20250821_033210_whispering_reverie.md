In slumber's realm where shadows softly dance,
The mind unfolds like petals in the night,
Where whispered secrets take their fleeting chance
To weave through darkness into morning light.

Dreams cascade like silver waterfalls,
Through corridors of memory and hope,
While echoed voices answer distant calls
From realms beyond our waking minds can scope.

Each vision spins a thread of golden hue,
That binds tomorrow to yesterday's lore,
Where fragments of the old create the new
And open every long-forgotten door.

So in this whispering reverie we find
The boundless landscapes of the dreaming mind.
