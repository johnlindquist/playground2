In cosmic depths where ancient starlight gleams,
A radiant echo calls across the night,
Through billion years it travels, speaks in dreams
Of distant suns that burst with silver light.

Each twinkling point a message from afar,
A whispered tale of worlds we'll never see,
The gleaming dance of each celestial star
Reveals the universe's symphony.

Time bends around these beacons in the dark,
Their photons carry stories untold,
While we below observe each glowing spark
And wonder at the mysteries they hold.

So when you gaze upon the starlit sky,
Remember echoes never truly die.
