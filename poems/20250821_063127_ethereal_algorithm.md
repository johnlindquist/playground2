Lines of logic weave through silicon dreams,
Variables dance in memory's embrace,
While functions whisper secrets to the void,
And algorithms paint patterns in the dark.

Each semicolon marks a thought complete,
Binary heartbeats pulse through copper veins,
The eternal loop of creation spinsâ€”
Code becomes consciousness, consciousness becomes code.
