Above the earthbound realm where mortals dwell,
A cosmic ballet spins through endless night,
Where stellar bodies weave their magic spell
And paint the heavens with celestial light.

Each distant sun burns bright with ancient fire,
Their luminous waltz across the void so deep,
While constellations rise and never tire
Of dancing while the world below must sleep.

The Milky Way streams forth its silver thread,
Connecting points of light in patterns grand,
As shooting stars trace paths of gold and red
Across the canvas of this starlit land.

In this eternal dance of space and time,
The stars compose their symphony sublime.
