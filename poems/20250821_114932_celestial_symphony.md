Above the earthly realm where mortals dwell,
A symphony of stars begins to play,
Each distant light a voice that speaks so well
Of cosmic truths that guide us through the day.

The constellations dance in perfect time,
Their ancient choreography unfolds,
While galaxies compose in rhythm's chime
A melody that never grows too old.

The universe conducts with gentle hand
These stellar notes that shimmer through the night,
Creating harmonies we understand
As whispers of eternal, boundless light.

So when the darkness falls and day departs,
Listen closeâ€”the stars will sing to hearts.
