Beyond the veil of cosmic dust and time,
Where ancient starlight weaves through endless night,
Each glowing ember speaks in silent rhyme
Of mysteries that dance beyond our sight.

The distant suns in their celestial halls
Cast silver threads across the void so deep,
While galaxies respond to cosmic calls
That echo through the universe's sleep.

Their radiance burns with stories yet untold,
Of worlds unborn and dreams that drift in space,
Each twinkling point a treasure more than gold,
Illuminating darkness with their grace.

Though far removed from earthly bonds they shine,
Their distant light makes mortal souls divine.
